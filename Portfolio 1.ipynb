    "two laps where the time trials include just one. \n",
    "\n",
    "Questions to explore with the data:\n",
    "* What is the overall distance travelled for each of the rides? What are the average speeds etc.  Provide a summary for each ride.\n",
    "* Compare the range of speeds for each ride, are time trials faster than road races? \n",
    "* Compare the speeds achieved in the two time trials (three years apart).  As well as looking at the averages, can you see where in the ride one or the other is faster.  \n",
    "* From the elevation_gain field you can see whether the rider is _climbing_ , _descending_ or on the _flat_.   Use this to calculate the average speeds in those three cases (climbing, flat or descending).  Note that _flat_ might not be zero elevation_gain but might allow for slight climbs and falls.  \n",

    "For time varying data like this it is often useful to _smooth_ the data using eg. a [rolling mean](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/version/0.17.0/generated/pandas.rolling_mean.html).  You might want to experiment with smoothing in some of your analysis (not required but may be of interest)."

    "\n",
    "A modern race bike has up to 22 different gears with two chainrings on the front (attached to the pedals) and 10 or 11 at the back (attached to the wheel).   The ratio of the number of teeth on the front and rear cogs determines the distance travelled with one revolution of the pedals (often called __development__, measured in metres).  Low development is good for climbing hills while high development is for going fast downhill or in the final sprint. \n",
    "\n",
    "We have a measure of the number of rotations of the pedals per minute (__cadence__) and a measure of __speed__.  Using these two variables we should be able to derive a measure of __development__ which would effectivly tell us which gear the rider was using at the time.   Development will normally range between __2m__ and __10m__.  Due to errors in GPS and cadence measurements you will see many points outside this range and you should just discard them as outliers. \n",
